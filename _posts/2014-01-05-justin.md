## Justin Garrison

Justin loves open source almost as much as he loves community.
He is not a fan of buzz words but searches for the patterns and benefits behind technology trends.
He frequently shares his findings and tries to disseminate knowledge through practical lessons and unique examples.
He is active in many communities and constantly questions the status quo.
He is relentless in trying to learn new things and giving back to the communities who have taught him so much.
